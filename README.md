Repo for borikanes.me

## Stack
- Nginx
- Front end: html, css, bootstrap
- Middleware: NodeJS, Flask
- DB: None yet

## CICD plan
The plan is to use Jenkins to help with continuous integration.  I'm going to have Jenkins listen on this repo and once there is a push to master it automatically deploys.
Also looking into Travis....
